	<h3>
		<a name="Concepts">Concepts</a>
	</h3>

	This framework provides a test framework for Java, based on the JDK
	1.8. The idea are similar to the idea of the others test framework.
	First of all here are two simple examples.

	<h4>Examples</h4>

	<h5>The Hello world test example</h5>

	<pre>
import ch.powerunit.Test;
import ch.powerunit.TestSuite;

public class HelloWorldTest implements TestSuite {
  &#64;Test()
  public void testHelloWorld1() {
    assertThat("Hello world").is(containsString(" "));
  }
 
}</pre>
	Several elements are interesting here :
	<ul>
		<li>The class implements the {@link ch.powerunit.TestSuite}. This
			is not strictly required by the framework but it is the best way to
			integrate nicely with the framework. This implementation provides the
			DSL of the framework (assertions, matchers, etc). As the interface
			name says it, a test class is considered as a test suite (has it
			should contains a set of test, that share a common fixture).</li>
		<li>The test method are annotated with the {@link
			ch.powerunit.Test} annotation.</li>
		<li>The {@link ch.powerunit.TestSuite assertThat} used here is
			one of the several way to do assertion. Here, only assertion based on
			DSL syntax and hamcrest matcher are provided. There is no AssertTrue
			for instance.</li>
	</ul>

	<h5>The Hello world with parameter test example</h5>

	<pre>
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.stream.Stream;

import ch.powerunit.Parameter;
import ch.powerunit.Parameters;
import ch.powerunit.Test;
import ch.powerunit.TestSuite;

public class HelloWorldParameterTest implements TestSuite {
  &#64;Parameters("Input string is {0}, subString idx is {1}, expected result is {2}")
  public static Stream&lt;Object[]&gt; getDatas() {
    return Arrays.stream(new Object[][] { { "ab", 0, "ab" }, { "ab", 1, "b" } });
  }

  &#64;Parameter(0)
  public String inputString;

  &#64;Parameter(1)
  public int inputIndex;

  &#64;Parameter(2)
  public String expectedString;

  &#64;Test
  public void testSubString() {
    assertThat(inputString.substring(inputIndex)).is(expectedString);
  }
}</pre>
	The interesting elements here are :
	<ul>
		<li>The concept of providing test parameter is similar to the one
			of JUnit, but there is no need to use an alternate test runner (in
			fact the concept of test runner doesn't exist in PowerUnit).</li>
		<li>Expected data provider type is <code>{@link
				java.util.stream.Stream Stream&lt;Object[]&gt;}</code>. As it is a stream,
			all new features of Java 8 (map, collect, etc) are available and can
			be defined prior returning the result.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Tests action sequences order</h4>

	Each test class is executed in isolation. The first action to be done
	is the instantiation of the class itself. Then the test execution can
	be :
	<ol>
		<li>If the test use the &#64;Parameters approach, the annotated
			method will be used to produce a list of input data. Each line of
			data will trigger the next step (injection at each run of the data
			into the field annotated &#64;Parameter); If the &#64;Parameters
			approach is not used, only one execution of the tests will be done.</li>
		<li>For each method annotated &#64;Test, an execution will be
			done. This execution will be based on the passed &#64;Rule, from the
			upper class to the lower class.</li>
	</ol>
	To demonstrate this sequence of action, here is an example of all
	theses concepts. Let's assume we have the two following classes :
	<pre>
import ch.powerunit.Rule;
import ch.powerunit.TestRule;
import ch.powerunit.TestSuite;
import ch.powerunit.rules.TestContextRule;

public abstract class ParentTest implements TestSuite {
  protected final TestContextRule context = new TestContextRule&lt;&gt;();

  &#64;Rule
  public final TestRule level1 = context.around(before(this::prepare1).around(after(this::clean1)));

  public final void prepare1() {
    System.out.println(context.getTestContext().getFullTestName() + ":prepare1");
  }

  public final void clean1() {
    System.out.println(context.getTestContext().getFullTestName() + ":clean1");
  }
}</pre>
	<p />
	<pre>
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.stream.Stream;

import ch.powerunit.Parameter;
import ch.powerunit.Parameters;
import ch.powerunit.Rule;
import ch.powerunit.Test;
import ch.powerunit.TestRule;

public class ChildrenTest extends ParentTest {

  &#64;Parameters
  public static Stream&lt;Object[]&gt; getDatas() {
    return Arrays.stream(new Object[][] { { "A" }, { "B" } });
  }

  &#64;Parameter(0)
  public String p1;

  &#64;Rule
  public final TestRule level2 = before(this::prepare2).around(after(this::clean2));

  public final void prepare2() {
    System.out.println(context.getTestContext().getFullTestName() + ":prepare2");
  }

  public final void clean2() {
    System.out.println(context.getTestContext().getFullTestName() + ":clean2");
  }

  &#64;Test
  public void test1() {
    System.out.println("test1 " + p1);
  }

  &#64;Test
  public void test2() {
    System.out.println("test2 " + p1);
  }
}
</pre>
	The first class
	<code>ParentTest</code>
	defines a first level of rules, that will provide information on the
	test execution, one method to be executed before each test, and one
	method to be executed after each test. Then the second class
	<code>ChildenTest</code>
	extends the previous one and defines a second level of rules, with all
	to before and after method. In addition, each test will be executed
	twice, once with
	<code>p1=A</code>
	, once with
	<code>p1=B</code>
	. The output of the execution will be :
	<pre>
ch.powerunit.examples.ChildrenTest:test2[0]:prepare1
ch.powerunit.examples.ChildrenTest:test2[0]:prepare2
test2 A
ch.powerunit.examples.ChildrenTest:test2[0]:clean2
ch.powerunit.examples.ChildrenTest:test2[0]:clean1
ch.powerunit.examples.ChildrenTest:test1[0]:prepare1
ch.powerunit.examples.ChildrenTest:test1[0]:prepare2
test1 A
ch.powerunit.examples.ChildrenTest:test1[0]:clean2
ch.powerunit.examples.ChildrenTest:test1[0]:clean1
ch.powerunit.examples.ChildrenTest:test2[1]:prepare1
ch.powerunit.examples.ChildrenTest:test2[1]:prepare2
test2 B
ch.powerunit.examples.ChildrenTest:test2[1]:clean2
ch.powerunit.examples.ChildrenTest:test2[1]:clean1
ch.powerunit.examples.ChildrenTest:test1[1]:prepare1
ch.powerunit.examples.ChildrenTest:test1[1]:prepare2
test1 B
ch.powerunit.examples.ChildrenTest:test1[1]:clean2
ch.powerunit.examples.ChildrenTest:test1[1]:clean1
</pre>
	It is possible to say that the before of the parent class are executed
	before the once of the children class. The after are executed in the
	reverse order. Also, as the before/after action use the result of the
	<code>TestContextRule</code>
	, it also show that this rule is execute before all others. As
	parameters were used, the trace indicate that the sequence of rule
	action are used for each parameter set, and for each test.
	<p />
	In some specific case, it is possible that one rule required, to be
	builded, that another one is already executed. To do so, the
	<code>around</code>
	method also support receiving a
	<code>Supplier</code>
	parameter, that will be used, at the very last moment, to build the
	rule.

	<h4>Assertion and Assumption usage</h4>

	Assertion and assumption are provided by the interface {@link
	ch.powerunit.TestSuite TestSuite} that may be implemented by the test
	class. Assertion and assumption use the same DSL language and
	capabilities, but they are started by a different methods :
	<ul>
		<li>The assertion are started by the methods named <code>assertXXX</code>.
			If the assertion fail, the test is marked as failed.
		</li>
		<li>The assumption are started by the methods named <code>assumeXXX</code>.
			If the assumption fail, the test is marked as skipped.
		</li>
		<li>The method named <code>fail</code> fail the tests.
	</ul>
	Several type of assertion/assumption are available :
	<ul>
		<li><b><code>assertThat</code>/<code>assumeThat</code></b><br />This
			is the much simple usage. The goal is here to validate the passed
			value against a specific check. The base syntax is (for the
			assertion): <pre>assertThat(myObject)...</pre> This method will
			return an instance of {@link ch.powerunit.AssertThatObject
			AssertThatObject}, which provides several method to validate the
			passed object (equality, nullability or application of a hamcrest
			matcher).
			<p />A specialized version of the <code>assertThat</code> method
			exists and return {@link ch.powerunit.AssertThatString
			AssertThatString}. This is an extension of AssertThatObject with
			additional methods related to string.
			<p /></li>
		<li><b><code>assertThatIterable</code>/<code>assumeThatIterable</code></b><br />This
			is an extension of the previous usage. The goal is here to validate
			the passed iterable value against a specific check. The base syntax
			is (for the assertion): <pre>assertThatIterable(myIterable)...</pre>
			This method will return an instance of {@link
			ch.powerunit.AssertThatIterable AssertThatIterable} (which is an
			extension of {@link ch.powerunit.AssertThatObject AssertThatObject}),
			providing the same features as before and several additional method
			to validate the iterable (size, contains).
			<p /></li>
		<li><b><code>assertThatFunction</code>/<code>assumeThatFunction</code></b><br />This
			is a much complicated assertion/assumption usage. Here the goal is to
			check the application of a <i>lambda</i> <i>function</i> on an input
			data. The base syntax is (for the assertion) :<pre>assertThatFunction((p)-&gt;p,myObject)...</pre>
			This method will return an instance of {@link
			ch.powerunit.AssertThatObject AssertThatObject}, which will be used
			to validate the result of the function application.
			<p /></li>
		<li><b><code>assertThatBiFunction</code>/<code>assumeThatBiFunction</code></b><br />This
			is a much complicated assertion/assumption usage. Here the goal is to
			check the application of a <i>lambda</i> <i>bifunction</i> on two
			input data. The base syntax is (for the assertion) :<pre>assertThatBiFunction((p1,p2)-&gt;p1+p2,myObject1,myObject2)...</pre>
			This method will return an instance of {@link
			ch.powerunit.AssertThatObject AssertThatObject}, which will be used
			to validate the result of the bifunction application.
			<p /></li>
		<li><b><code>assertWhen</code>/<code>assumeWhen</code></b><br />This
			is the approach to validate that some piece of code is throwing an
			expected exception. This assertion/assumption will fail in case the
			code doesn't thrown an exception or the thrown exception is not
			accepted by the provided matcher. The base syntax is (for the
			assertion) :<pre>assertWhen((p)-&gt;{/*...*/})...</pre> This method
			will return an instance of {@link ch.powerunit.AssertThatException},
			which will provide a way to specify the matcher to be used to check
			the thrown exception.
			<p /></li>
	</ul>
	The provides matcher also support the new {@link java.util.Optional
	Optional} concept of Java 8.

	<h3>
		<a name="Annotations processor">Annotations processor</a>
	</h3>
	PowerUnit provides an integration out of the box with the annotation
	processor of the java compiler. This is provided by the {@link
	org.power.processor.PowerUnitProcessor PowerUnitProcessor}. The goal of
	this annotation processor is double :
	<ul>
		<li>First of all, this processor do some check on the code, to
			ensure that the annotation provided by PowerUnit are correctly used.
			Some check can only be done at runtime, but here it provides a way to
			do some check at compile time. All non correct usage detected at this
			stage are reported by the compiler as warning. For instance, the
			usage of the annotation <code>Test</code> on a non public method will
			be reported as <pre>[WARNING] Method testPrivateMethod() of ch.powerunit.test.base.RuntimeTestValidatorTests.TestClass5
    is prefixed with @Test and is not public 
    A test method must be public</pre>
		</li>
		<li>A main class (<code>ch.powerunit.suite.Suites</code>) is
			generated to provide a way to manually run the test. This an be use
			for instance in context where no integration is available.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>
		<a name="Surefire integration">Surefire integration</a>
	</h3>
	This test system can integrated out of the box with Surefire. This is
	done by adding this package as a dependencies of the surefire plugin :
	<pre>
&lt;plugin&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.apache.maven.plugins&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-surefire-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;dependencies&gt;
    &lt;dependency&gt;
      &lt;groupId&gt;ch.powerunit&lt;/groupId&gt;
      &lt;artifactId&gt;powerunit&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;/dependency&gt;
  &lt;/dependencies&gt;
&lt;/plugin&gt;</pre>

	<h3>
		<a name="About Hamcrest integration">About Hamcrest integration</a>
	</h3>
	Hamcrest is integrated with this framework, as a maven dependency. Here
	the {@link ch.powerunit.TestSuite TestSuite} interface provides the
	standard hamcrest DSL features, with some additional matcher (for
	exception and the new {@link java.util.Optional Optional} class for
	instance).

	<h3>
		<a name="Test framework creation">Test framework creation</a>
	</h3>
	A special feature of PowerUnit exists to help creation of test
	framework. The idea is here to be able to wrote a normal test case and
	be able to expose it to normal test classes. This is done by using
	three annotations :
	<code>TestDelegator</code>
	,
	<code>TestInterface</code>
	and
	<code>TestDelegate</code>
	. The annotation
	<code>TestDelegate</code>
	is used by the user of the test framework ; the two other annotations
	are used by the test test framework developer. Let's assume, for the
	example that we like to provide a test framework to validate the
	Fibonacci function. To do so, we first need a class that can be used
	from the test, define which method must be tested. This can be done
	with the following class :
	<pre>
import ch.powerunit.TestInterface;

&#64;TestInterface(FiboUsingFilteringTester.class)
public class FiboTestInterface {
    public interface Fibo {
        int fibo(int x);
    }
    
    private final Fibo method;

    public FiboTestInterface(Fibo method) {
        this.method=method;
    }
    
    public Fibo getMethod() {
        return method;
    }
}
</pre>
	This class use the annotation
	<code>TestInterface</code>
	and is just a simple POJO. In this case we use a functional interface
	to receive the method to be tested ; The annotation reference an other
	class, which is the implementation of the test :
	<pre>
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.function.BiFunction;
import java.util.stream.Stream;

import ch.powerunit.Parameter;
import ch.powerunit.Parameters;
import ch.powerunit.Test;
import ch.powerunit.TestDelegator;
import ch.powerunit.TestSuite;

&#64;TestDelegator
public class FiboUsingFilteringTester implements TestSuite {

    &#64;Parameters()
    public static Stream&lt;Object[]&gt; getDatas(FiboTestInterface param) {
        return Arrays
                .stream(new Object[][] { { 0, 0, null }, { 1, 1, null },
                        { 2, 1, null }, { 3, 2, null }, { 4, 3, null },
                        { 10, 55, null },
                        { -1, -1, IllegalArgumentException.class } })
                .map(TestSuite.DSL.addFieldToEachEntry(param.getMethod()))
                .map(TestSuite.DSL
                        .&lt;BiFunction
			&lt;String , Object[], Boolean&gt;&gt; addFieldToEachEntry(FiboUsingFilteringTester::validateTestMethod));
    }

    private static boolean validateTestMethod(String name, Object parameters[]) {
        if (parameters[2] == null) {
            return "testFib".equals(name);
        }
        return "testFibException".equals(name);
    }

    &#64;Parameter(0)
    public int x;

    &#64;Parameter(1)
    public int y;

    &#64;Parameter(2)
    public Class&lt;?&gt; expectedException;

    &#64;Parameter(3)
    public FiboTestInterface.Fibo method;

    &#64;Parameter(value = 4, filter = true)
    public BiFunction&lt;String, Object[], Boolean&gt; filter;

    &#64;Test(name = "validate the fib suite : {0}-&gt;{1}")
    public void testFib() {
        assertThat(method.fibo(x)).is(y);
    }

    &#64;Test(name = "Validate exception is {2}")
    public void testFibException() {
        assertWhen((p) -&gt; {
            method.fibo(x);
        }).throwException(instanceOf(expectedException));
    }

}
</pre>
	This is a
	<i>normal</i> test class, but this class is annotated with
	<code>TestDelegator</code>
	, is required to be a parameterized test and the method annotated with
	<code>Parameters</code>
	has one parameter which is the class defined previously.
	<br /> The user of the framework will only be required to know the
	class annotated with
	<code>TestInterface</code>
	. To use the framework, it is possible to do :
	<pre>
import ch.powerunit.Categories;
import ch.powerunit.TestDelegate;
import ch.powerunit.TestSuite;

&#64;Categories({ "example", "demo" })
public class FiboTest implements TestSuite {
    &#64;TestDelegate
    public final FiboTestInterface delegate = new FiboTestInterface(
            new ch.powerunit.demo.Fibo()::fibo);

}
	</pre>
	Field annotated with &#64;TestDelegate will be used to indicate a test
	delegation ; The value of the field (or if the field is a Supplier the
	result of the execution of the Supplier, which is done for every test
	execution in case of parameterized test) is use to find the test class
	delegation and is passed to the
	<code>Parameters</code>
	annotated method. When the
	<code>FiboTest</code>
	class is executed as a test, the output will look like :<br/>
	<img src="ch/powerunit/doc-files/sample_framework.png" />
	<br /> Even if the test class only have one field, the result contains
	the execution of the delegated test class, as if it was the user test
	class.
